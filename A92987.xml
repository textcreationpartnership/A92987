            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:115784:3"/>II. Under the pretence of Religion and liberty, there lyes lurking the spawn of that old Toad, who hath poisoned the free born people of these three Nations with damnable heresies, and so infringed the rights of many noble persons, that we can call nothing our own but what their damnable charity please to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow upon us.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Our pulpets are now become stages, to cry up our new Gospel-mungers, who Ape▪ like, would imitate any thing that springs from a new fashioned heretick, and thank God twice a year for the prosperity of that old Tyrant, who drencht the ground with the blood of those▪ whose shoos he was not worthy to unloose; therefore may we thank God that he and his Imps are purged from amongst us.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Religion had almost broke its neck down <hi>White-hall</hi> steps, and the good Common-wealths men of these three Nations sorely oppressed with Taxes, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him and his privy▪ Councel, whom I may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to my Lord Marquess <hi>Fool,</hi> alwayes imployed though never doing good.</p>

How hath this Nation been opprest with unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry taxes by our rebellious traytors who commanded their Plate, Jewels, Bodkins, Whistles, Ear-rings, and fifty two subsidies at a time, free loan, lent money, weekly rates, monthly Sessments, and dedicated to our Idol Parliament, whose Counsels were adored as Demi-gods; thus our rebellion against God, disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to our King, and idolatry committed with the trayterous Army, hath brough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">VI. And to argue that their consequent slavery is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, I say, what Nation ever endured such tyrannical bondage upon such slight occasions? Nay, how are Jorneymen-Coblers advanced to places of dignity and honor, and our Court of State now to be sold to raise a Dowry for the old VVitch, and to maintain a Venice publike Stew at the Common-wealths charge, that so our weak Brethren may make use of holy Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters?</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Hath it not been their practice for several years, to advance themselves on other mens ruines, and instead
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115784:4"/> of being served by the Milk of the gospel, we have been choaked with the poyson of asps, and robb'd of our ancient customs, all our freedoms infringed, and our Priviledges violated; and is not the old Proverb verified?</p>
